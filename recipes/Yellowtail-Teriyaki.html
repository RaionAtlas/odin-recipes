    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
     <li>2 yellowtail (buri or hamachi) fillets (approx. 220g each)</li>
     <li>1 tsp salt</li>
     <li>1 tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
     <li>1 tablespoon neutral oil (e.g., vegetable oil)</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
     <li>2 tablespoons sake</li>
     <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
</ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>

<ol>
     <li><p><strong>Prepare the Fish:</strong> Lightly sprinkle salt on both sides of the yellowtail fillets and let them rest for 10 minutes. This helps remove excess moisture and odor.</p></li>
     <li><p><strong>Make the Sauce:</strong> In a small bowl, mix the soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar until the sugar dissolves.</p></li>
     <li><p><strong>Cook the Fish:</strong> Heat vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan over medium heat.Place the yellowtail fillets skin-side down and sear for about 3–4 minutes, until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side for another 2–3 minutes.</p></li>
     <li><p><strong>Add the Sauce:</strong> Reduce the heat to low and pour in the teriyaki sauce. Spoon the sauce over the fish as it simmers and thickens, about 2–3 minutes, until the fillets are coated in a glossy glaze.</p></li>
     <li><p><strong>Serve:</strong> Plate the fish with a side of grated daikon and a shiso leaf if desired. Serve immediately with steamed rice and miso soup.</p></li>
